# SDDirect File Format Documentation

## Overview
The SDDirect file format is used for generating structured data files that comply with the specifications required for processing. This document outlines the structure, requirements, and validation rules for the SDDirect file format.

## Structure
The SDDirect file consists of multiple sections, each containing specific fields that must be populated according to the defined schema. The primary sections include:

1. **Header**
   - Contains metadata about the file, such as the file type, version, and creation date.

2. **Data Records**
   - Each record represents a single entry in the file and must adhere to the defined field specifications.

3. **Footer**
   - Provides summary information about the file, including the total number of records.

## Field Requirements
Each field in the SDDirect file must meet the following criteria:

- **Field Name**: The name of the field as defined in the schema.
- **Data Type**: The expected data type (e.g., string, number, date).
- **Required**: Indicates whether the field is mandatory.
- **Validation Rules**: Specific rules that the field data must satisfy (e.g., length, format).

## Validation
The SDDirect file format includes validation rules to ensure data integrity. The following validations are performed:

- **Field-Level Validation**: Each field is validated against its defined rules.
- **Record Validation**: Each record is checked for completeness and correctness.
- **File-Level Validation**: The entire file is validated to ensure it meets the overall structure and requirements.

## Example
An example of a valid SDDirect file structure is as follows:

```
HEADER
FileType: SDDirect
Version: 1.0
CreationDate: 2023-10-01

DATA RECORDS
Record1: { Field1: "Value1", Field2: "Value2" }
Record2: { Field1: "Value3", Field2: "Value4" }

FOOTER
TotalRecords: 2
```

## Conclusion
The SDDirect file format is designed to facilitate the generation of structured data files while ensuring compliance with validation rules. Proper adherence to the structure and requirements outlined in this document is essential for successful file generation and processing.
